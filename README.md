🚀 **Passionate Developer with over 27 years of tech experience.**

I started my journey in programming at the age of 12, diving into the exciting world of cybersecurity. Over time, my curiosity led me to backend development, and today I’m a frontend expert with more than 10 years of experience crafting seamless, high-performance web technologies. 💻✨

I’ve worked with **HTML**, **CSS**, **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Vue**, **React**, and recently, **Python** 🐍. Currently, I’m fully immersed in the world of **Artificial Intelligence** 🤖, constantly exploring new frontiers in tech.

Always learning, always innovating! 🚀🌍
